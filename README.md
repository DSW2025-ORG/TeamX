# Data Science Workflows (ADC 2025)

This repository hosts the materials for the course **Data Science Workflows**, delivered in 2025 within the **Complex Data Analysis** program, **Faculty of Sociology and Social Work, Babeș-Bolyai University**.
As the course is in Romanian, the materials in this repository are also in Romanian.

The course introduces practical data science workflows using real-world data and standard analytical tools. It is designed for students and for a broader audience interested in applied data analysis and reproducible research practices.

## Course scope
The course covers the full data workflow, from problem definition to analysis and communication of results, with emphasis on:
- working with real, publicly available datasets;
- integrating multiple data sources;
- structuring and documenting data analysis projects;
- exploratory and basic statistical analysis;
- collaborative work and reproducibility using GitHub.

## Repository structure
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting materials organized by topic and workflow stage. All notebooks are documented using Markdown and include explanatory comments.

The materials include:
- introductory notebooks on data workflows and project setup;
- data collection and processing examples using energy data (EIA);
- data collection and processing examples using socio-economic indicators (WDI);
- data cleaning and aggregation workflows;
- exploratory data analysis and basic statistical analysis;
- methodological support for the final course project.

## Team project repositories
Within the GitHub **organization associated with this course**, you will also find the **repositories of the student teams’ final projects**.

Each team repository includes:
- the project notebooks;
- processed datasets;
- a final report integrated into the repository `README.md`;
- analytical results and conclusions.

These repositories demonstrate applied use of the methods and workflows introduced in the course.

## Data sources
The course relies exclusively on public data sources, primarily:
- **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)** – energy production, consumption, and emissions data;
- **World Development Indicators (World Bank)** – socio-economic indicators;
- additional public datasets, where relevant to specific analyses.

All data preparation steps are explicitly documented in the notebooks.

## Final project
The final project is completed in teams and applies the full workflow presented in the course. Students:
- define a data-driven research question;
- collect and integrate data from public sources;
- construct a cleaned and aggregated dataset;
- perform exploratory and statistical analyses;
- document the entire process in a GitHub repository.

Detailed project instructions are provided in the course materials.

## Assessment
Project evaluation is based on:
- the quality and clarity of the code and notebooks hosted on GitHub;
- the final report integrated into the project `README.md`;
- the final team presentation, in which each member highlights their individual contribution.

## Tools and technologies
- Python and Jupyter Notebook;
- Git and GitHub;
- relational databases (PostgreSQL / Neon);
- standard data analysis libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
